# WigglyAppendage2D
A node for adding long dynamic appendages like tails, loose ropes and antennas to characters and other moving objects.

These appendages don't use realistic physics, instead they use a simplified approximation of physics that's designed to look good visually and naturally handle a lot of types of movement, including discontinuous movement. They also support being scaled and flipped.
