# Overview & definitions
An appendage is made out of a small amount of physically simulated points, which from now on Iâ€™ll simply call points. The first of these points I call the root point, its location is always the global position of the appendage node.

The rotation of each point is considered to be the angle of the vector from its previous point to itself (the rotation of the root point is the global rotation of the appendage node). The target rotation of each point is the rotation it "wants to" be at.

The array of points is subdivided and smoothed before being set as the `points` for the `Line2D` class the appendages inherit from (this step is skipped if `subdivision` is 0).

# Member variables
## int `segment_count`
The amount of points the appendage will have. This doesn't count the root node, so the size of `physics_points` is `segment_count + 1`.

Setting this variable will call the `reset()` function.

## float `segment_length`
The distance each point will be from its previous point (in pixels).

## float `curvature`
The target rotation of each point relative to its previous point (in radians).

## float `curvature_exponent`
A value that affects the target rotation of each point.

The target rotation of each point is calculated using the following formula:
```
Target rotation = Rotation of previous point + [curvature] * Index ^ [curvature_exponent]
```
(`Index` is a number that starts at 0 for the root point and increases by 1 for every consecutive point)

## float `max_angle`
How far the rotation of each point it allowed to deviate from its target rotation (in radians).

If this value is >= `TAU / 2`, all points will be able to rotate freely. *

\* The effects of `stiffness` still apply.

## float `comeback_speed`
If a point's rotation reaches its `max_angle`, its angular momentum (in radians/sec) will be set to this value going towards its target rotation. *

\* If a point is already moving towards its target rotation faster than `comeback_speed`, it's angular momentum will be left unchanged.

## float `stiffness`
What rotational force (in radians/sec^2) should be applied to each point to move it towards its target rotation

## float `stiffness_decay`
A value that controls the `stiffness` for each individual point.

to see how exactly it does so, see `stiffness_decay_exponent`.

## float `stiffness_decay_exponent`
A value that controls the `stiffness` for each individual point.

The stiffness for each individual point is calculated suing the following formula:
```
Point Stiffness = [stiffness] - Index ^ [stiffness_decay_exponent] * [stiffness_decay]
```
(`Index` is a number that starts at 0 for the root point and increases by 1 for every consecutive point)

## Vector2 `gravity`
All points have a rotational force (in radians/sec^2) that simulates `gravity` acting on them.

This is the formula used to calculate said force:
```
Rotational force = Length(gravity) * cos(point_rotation - Angle(gravity) + TAU / 4)
```
(`Length()` and `Angle()` are self-explanatory functions)

(I don't know if this formula is correct, but it works well enough)

## float `damping`
If a point is rotating away form it's target rotation, all forces acting on it (including gravity) will get multiplied by this value.

## float `max_angular_momentum`
The maximum speed (in radians/sec) each point is allowed to rotate at.

## int `subdivision`
How much subdivision to apply to the points before rendering them as a line.

To know how much `subdivision` will increase the amount of points, use the following formula:
```
Amount of points after subdivision = ceil((Amount of points before subdivision - 0.5) * [subdivision])
if [subdivision] is even, Amount of points after subdivision += 1
```
It's also worth noted that the subdivision algorithm doesn't necessarily produce evenly spaced-out points.

If `subdivision` is 0, the subdivision step will be skipped entirely.

`subdivision` should never be 1, it won't increase the amount of points and it looks worse than having `subdivision` at 0 while still having a performance impact.

## bool `additional_start_segment`
If true, adds `Vector2(-additional_start_segment_length, 0)` to the start of the `points` array of `Line2D`.

## float `additional_start_segment_length`
See `additional_start_segment`.

## bool `subdivide_additional_start_segment`
If true, the `additional_start_segment` will be added before the subdivision step, else, it will be added afterwards.

## bool `only_process_when_visible`
If true, `is_visible_in_tree()` will be called at the beginning of every process loop and if it returns true, the process loop will be skipped.

## Array `physics_points`
An array that contains all the information about the physically simulated points.

This array is what is used internally to process the points.

**ðŸ”´This is not an array of vectorsðŸ”´**, instead, it's an array of arrays.

Each sub array contains the following information at these indexes:

0. Reference to the previous point array
1. Global position of the point
2. Global rotation of the point
3. Global angular momentum of the point (in radians/sec^2)

You shouldn't need to access this variable, if you want the positions of all physically simulated points, consider using `get_global_point_positions()`.

# Member functions
## void `reset`(int `point_count` = `segment_count` + 1)
Removes all points from `physics_points` and adds back the amount specified by `point_count`.

Call this function if you want to reset the position and momentum of all points.

You should never specify the `point_count` parameter, it should always be at its default value.

## PoolVector2Array `get_global_point_positions`()
Returns an array of the global positions of all points in `physics_points`.
